- A Drow that was acting as a spy for parties unknown.
- Originally the party thought that he was acting as a spy for [[Lord Neverember]] to spy on [[Aarlon]], but [[Lord Neverember]] later said he had never hired any such spy.
- After the party's return from the [[Shadowfell]], they learn that [[Lord Neverember]] is now being relentlessly shadowed by a Drow spy and suspect that this is the same person.
