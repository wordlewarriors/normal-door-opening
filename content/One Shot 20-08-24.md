- We are called in to see [[Aarlon]], it is late in the day.  
- [[Thisiman]] and [[Barris]] have taken this call and are informed that the stable of [[Lord Neverember]]’s aunty is haunted, so we’re sent to check it out, at [[Amblecrown Manor]]
	- There are 1-2+ servants.
- We head to the manor. It’s currently too early for undead. 
- [[Amblecrown Manor]] was clearly once fancy, but is now crumbling. The stable block is set slightly back from the road. There are lights on in the house. 
- We approach the house.
	- We are met by the butler [[Mephistus]] and shown into the dusty house.
	- An elderly lady is brought in. She is a bit batty looking and asks if “wee Daggie” sent us. She is quite dishevelled and is wearing only one black pearl earring. 
	- She hears howling from the stable block. She thinks it’s a banshee. Ever since her manservant died it’s been very strange.
	- The manservant died out in the city of the plague.  She thinks he was keeping the howling away.
	- She has no evidence. The howling happenings for ”quite some time” only at night. She can hear it from inside the house. [[Mephistus]] has also heard it.
	- The howling comes from the direction of the stables, but it could be the gardens. 
- [[Barris]] knows about Banshees. They scream, not howl. 
- [[Mephistus]] shows us the stables and then goes inside.
	- There are no screams or howls coming from the building. 
	- [[Barris]] casts disguise self to look like [[Mephistus]]. We head inside.
	- There are some wine barrels. [[Barris]] sees a rat. [[Thisiman]] can feel a breeze coming from behind some barrels and finds a **secret** door. It has a handle. 
	- [[Barris]] opens the door with mage hand. The flow of air increases and a feather drifts out, which [[Barris]] grabs with his mage hand. It is a black feather. [[Thisiman]] thinks its from a Corvid.
	- [[Thisiman]] collects his axe and the rat corpse. 
	- Behind the door is a staircase that winds down for a long way. There is another door at the bottom. Behind it is a study.
- There are bookshelves on 3 walls, a big table with an open book on it and the far end of the room is dark with inky blackness that we cannot see through.
- [[Thisiman]] casts light, so [[Barris]] does so too.
- [[Barris]] checks the books for anything that looks out of place. The room looks like a working study, so the books are well used and have the air of being well used.
- [[Thisiman]] approaches the table. The table is made of stone. The book has a title “The Mysticatum Majorum”. A black pearl earring is being used as a bookmark on a certain page. 
	- This looks like a match for the one earring that [[Lady Amblecrown]] was wearing!
	- The book is bound in what appears to be cow skin. 
	- [[Barris]] checks the book - the bookmarked page contained a spell that is some sort of conjugation magic. It appears to be on the evil side. 
	- [[Barris]] takes the book and the earring for safe keeping. 
- [[Barris]] casts light on a book and [[Thisiman]] throws it into the blackness, where it appears to keep going (we don’t hear it hit anything). A few seconds pass and 3 shadows emerge from the shadow.
- 3 shadows emerge. They miss us, then [[Barris]] throws an eldrich blast at one.
- [[Thisiman]] strikes down a shadow. It’s friend hits him back hard. 
- [[Barris]] Is hit by one as he moves away and then hits it back hard with an eldrich blast. [[Thisiman]] chops the remaining 2 in half a then a howling noise begins from behind the darkness curtain.
- [[Barris]] casts bless on us both as [[Thisiman]] charges the darkness. A young red shadow dragon appears. 
- [[Thisiman]] charges the dragon with a couple of mighty blows. [[Barris]] curses the creature and throws eldrich blast at him.
- The dragon claws [[Thisiman]] who responds by giving it a mighty hit. [[Barris]] fails to hit it with eldrich blast,  so he doubles down and hits with his next 2. [[Thisiman]] hits the dragon with 3 mighty blows and fells it.
- We head through the darkness and appear in a dark fell place that looks deserted. We head back through the portal and harvest some dragon parts and then hop back again.
- We take a short rest and notice that the blackness of the portal seems to be fading slightly. 
- We return to speak to [[Lady Amblecrown]] and tell [[Mephistus]] what we found along the way.  He is shocked.
	- [[Barris]] suggests to her that her use of a hypothetical book got out of hand. [[Thisiman]] puts the dragon head on the table.
	- [[Lady Amblecrown]] says she was just trying to do good. She was told by her granddad [[Victor Amblecrown]] that this book would get her out of trouble.
	- [[Barris]] tells her he is confiscating the book for safe keeping and that we have resolved the problem with the howling. 
	- [[Barris]] tells her that we will get someone from the [[Neverwinter Academy]] to come and check out the study.
	- We head towards [[Neverwinter Academy]] fighting undead as we go, to find a wizard to report the book to & come fix the portal.
