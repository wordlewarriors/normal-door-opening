#Neverwinter 
- [[Ultrin]] remembers that the Leonard family - they are suppliers of many different shops, as a wholesaler import/export selling to different locations
	- [[Ultrin]]’s salary at the [[Neverwinter Academy]] is kept to a minimum to ensure that he is not corrupted by wealth
- We head to the Protector’s Enclave and to the Leonard family mansion. It is now past sunset, getting into the Danger Zone. There are guards, mages and clergy patrolling.
- There are lights on in the manner and curtains are drawn. It looks like there is at least 1 person home and awake.
	- [[Merric]] picks the lock at the street entrance, very quickly - leaving it as if someone had just forgot to lock the gate.
	- Everyone makes their way into the grounds of the manor in a stealthy manner
- [[Merric]] and [[Aust]] head around the side to find a servant’s entrance. The door is barred with a heavy wooden block and [[Merric]] opens the bar quietly to unlock the door.
- [[Jorund]] knocks at the door and a window within the door slides across, showing an elderly gentleman who is suspicious of him.
	- [[Jorund]] informs the man that the house is insecure. The man informs [[Jorund]] that he is suspicious of anyone turning. 
- [[Merric]] and [[Aust]] emerge into a poor person’s cloakroom and can see a storeroom and kitchen. [[Aust]] can hear [[Jorund]] speaking with someone. We start heading into the house, via the kitchen, to head upstairs. Someone opens a door at the fair end of the kitchen and light floods in. An elderly (40/50s) man appears, he is well dressed in a fancy silken nightgown.
	- We head through a dining room into a foyer with a grand staircase. We see the key to the front door is left on the inside of the lock.
	- We head up to the top of the 3 story mansion, the art work gets fancier. On the 2nd floor there are 5-6 closed doors off a landing and another staircase leads up. We head to the top floor. 
- [[Jorund]] attempts to contact [[Merric]] and [[Aust]] but gets no response. The old man opens the door and looks alarmed and stunned that [[Jorund]] was right. The man wants to call the guard but [[Jorund]] and [[Ultrin]] convince him that they are the people to call.
	- They convince the man to stick with them. They are noisy and slow. [[Ultrin]] starts ritual casting Detect Magic. 
	- The old man tells them that his son is in a bedroom on the 2nd floor, so they decide to go there and protect him. 
	- The man tells them that the import/export business is tough but there is trade happening within the city. 
- [[Merric]] and [[Aust]] reach the top floor, feels like walking into some sort of museum - there are many artefacts/weapons/shields/amulets spread about. There are also bookshelves. 
	- [[Aust]] heads for the objects - each has a little plaque that describes what they did  - they seem inert. [[Aust]] doesn’t really recognise any of the names or locations.
	- [[Merric]] heads for the books - there are a lot of supposed first editions of many different books, some are quite impressive. There are some books on the gods of greed, but that doesn’t seem surprising for a wealthy family.
	- We head downstairs
- [[Jorund]] and [[Ultrin]] head up to the 2nd floor. They head towards a lighted room, to meet [[Joseph Leonard]] (the old man is [[Frank Leonard]]). 
	- The old man doesn’t admit to any expensive items that cant be easily replaced.
	- When knocking on Joseph’s door there is no response. The room is lit buy a burning candle sat on a desk. There is also a bed. There is no Joseph. 
	- He was last seen at dinner a couple of hours ago. He often disappears into his bedroom early to “study” in preparation for taking over the family business.
	- They check the other rooms to see if he is there. There is a theory he went to the bathroom. 
- [[Merric]] and [[Aust]] start checking rooms. 
	- The first is a bathroom that smells like someone bathed here recently.
	- The next room is a study. There is a locked safe and a locked desk drawer, against a window overlooking the street.
	- [[Merric]] opens the locked drawer - finds a leather bound book, quite thick and many sheets of parchment slotted in. It is a log of most of the family’s customers and trade agreements (no itemised sale and purchase, more general details) - LOTS of names. Many pages have details about illicit activities and rumours - in the way that traders could extort money out of people or favourable deals - but no record of this being used. [[Aust]] guards the door.
	- [[Merric]] finds that the family has a great arrangement with the city, supplying the guard with all their needs for non-magical items (magic stuff is from  [[Neverwinter Academy]]) and are being paid WAAAYYY too much. They have MANY rumours about [[Lord Neverember]] - many of which we suspect to be true (rumours that he is stingy and is bribing many people to remain in power, possibly even rigging elections to remain lord protector).
	- No mention of [[My Chemical Reagents]] - who do their own “import/export”
	- There is a page on every [[Council of Neverwinter]] member - there is a rumour about [[Ivaran Sylhorn]] being a non-pure blood high elf (even though he is proud of his heritage as a pure blood). 
	- No rumours logged against [[Amelia Briar]] - but she seems to be related to why the house is getting such a good deal with the city and that there seems to be donations to [[Lord Neverember]] standing for election and suggestions that he keep on [[Amelia Briar]].
	- Seems odd that there is no dirt on [[Amelia Briar]]
- [[Ultrin]] finishes casting his spell and checks out the window to see if [[Joseph Leonard]] could have snuck out that way. [[Ultrin]] and [[Frank Leonard]] move out into the hallway as [[Jorund]] stays put. 
	- They check out the bathroom and Frank says he hasn’t had a bath so [[Ultrin]] claims that Joseph must clearly have had a bath.
	- Frank realises he didn’t lock the side door and [[Ultrin]] suggests they go back down and start again.
	- Frank suggests that he hire some private investigators to try and find his son so long as he’s sure he’s really safe and hasn’t been abducted.
- [[Jorund]] searches Joseph’s room. 
	- There are various study materials spread across the desk, but he also finds “Baron of the Circles” - which seems to be a prerelease draft, authored by [[Bolkien]] and seems to be part of a series of books that he has got the jump on.
	- There is also a journal filled with iterations of poorly written romantic poetry.
- [[Jorund]] asks Frank if Joseph has been seeing any young ladies. He is told that they haven’t really seen many people. The servants don’t stay overnight. No regular visitors.
- [[Jorund]] and [[Ultrin]] head back downstairs with Frank to secure the side door and search for magical items. 
- [[Merric]] breaks into the safe. Inside are deeds to various properties (this mansion &  ==2 different warehouses== in the Protector’s enclave) and an amulet. 
	- The amulet is solid gold and has a red gem set into it, it could be worn as a pendant. It appears to be magical and requires some level of attunement.
	- [[Merric]] takes note of the warehouse addresses and puts everything back
	- [[Merric]] heads into a bedroom - seems a bit more feminine but seems unused. There is a locked jewellery box. 
	- [[Merric]] heads into another bedroom - probably guest room, nothing of interest
	- [[Merric]] heads into a child’s room - looks staged as if its not being used.
	- [[Merric]] finally checks [[Joseph Leonard]]’s room - which does look lived in.
- [[Merric]] heads to the ground floor and searches for another study or bedroom. 
	- He finds some servants quarters that look lived in but currently empty. He also finds the cellar is used more for storage of beer/wine/boxes (no interesting seals on them)
	- It looks as if [[Frank Leonard]] is living in an armchair on the ground floor, with a pile of supplies next to it and a good view of the front gate to the property. Seems to track with the level of paranoia. But seems odd that he didn’t notice his son vanish.
- The Leonard family portrait has 3 children - 2 boys and a girl.
