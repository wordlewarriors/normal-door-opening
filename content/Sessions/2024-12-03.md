## At [[Ivaran Sylhorn]]’s manor
- [[Aust]] and [[Merric]] investigate the entrance room. [[Merric]] searches the 3-4 jackets and pairs of boots. The jackets are all the same size, finding a seal of the [[Council of Neverwinter]], depicting the department of Health, which he pockets. He also finds a set of keys, which he takes. 
- Searching the main room for traps, there are nothing obvious but there are 2 suspicious suits of armour that seem inanimate but strange. They look elven but the metal seems off (dark).
- The general feeling of the room is it is posed as a show room, but it feels off. 
- Inside the room that had shown a light is a dining room. There is a faint smell of must/decay. A single long ornate table of dark oak dominates the room, it seems to have seen heavy use. The table is set for a mean, with 5 places. Dust has gathered over the setting, as if it has been left for days to weeks. 
	- The silverwear has subtle web designs engraved
	- There is an alcohol cabinet to the right and a crystal decanter standing atop it has a deep red liquid in it. There are drawn velvet curtains to either side of the cabinet.
		- These seem to be hiding a mural on the wall rather than a window.
		- There is a grand mural, depicting an elven feast, but it seems uncanny, with twisted faces and decayed food that is rotten. Could possibly be a celebration of a poison banquette. 
	- The bay window seems to have curtains made of spider silk.
	- Opening the decanter, the smell causes a wave of nostalgia and thinking back to previous meals. [[Merric]] stares at the decanter for a minute before snapping out of a reverie. There seems to be a strong mind altering component to this. (Is illusion magic under detect magic)
	- There is also an enchanted lock (Arachne lock) under the candelabra in the centre of the table. 
- [[Merric]] and [[Ultrin]] open the doors into a kitchen and servants quarters. There is an iron stove and cooking hearth, scattered pots and pans, some with remnants of food going (recently) mouldy. There is a herb rack (with exotic herbs) and a potion rack. There are stairs leading upwards and a pantry.
	- The writing on the herbs uses eleven script. [[Aust]] recognises them as herbs from the under dark, used for poison. 
	- One jar contains glowing mould that is threatening to outgrow the jar. The label says “Distillate of [[Araumycos]]. Warning, do not inhale too deeply” 
	- The pantry door is open but it is dark. There is a black and white fungus that has grown out from its source and across the floor. 
		- [[Aust]] recognises this often grows on a decaying corpse. Do not eat it or inhale spores. He finds it has grown off the contents of the pantry. The mould has spread more than it should given the food source and the room.
	- There is a hatch to access a probable cellar.
	- There is an old tattered journal tucked into a corner of the room.
		- It is something of a mix of a logbook and diary maintained by multiple people. There is a daily entry of stores and what the “master” wishes to eat. It only speaks of one master, not a full family or others. 
		- The logbook becomes unhinged In its purchases overtime - underdark hearbs and “delicacies from home”
		- Starts speaking of “the master’s associates” and preparing celebratory feasts for multiple people for the final 2w. Final entry is 5d ago. 
- Another room is a Library. There is furnature facing a small central table strune with books. Spider silk curtains cover the windows. The bookshelves are filled with religious texts for pretty much every god and pantheon. There is a section on [[Lolth]] which is larger than the rest. A glass fronted bookshelf has books on [[Kyransalee]] (with a glyph of warding).
- There is a sitting room with a polished grand piano covered in dust. There are plush pieces of furniture around the fireplace and embroidered with spiderweb patterns.  
	- An expensive looking chess set, the onyx pieces are dark elven figures, the ivory pieces are skeletons. The chess game is setup and midway through game but is also dusty. 
	- The piano keys and the chess set are enchanted.  The piano seems enchanted to play itself under some circumstance. The chess set is enchanted to do something when the game ends.
	- The fireplace mantle has a draw built in. It contains a few vials of dark liquid and a scrawled note in fake script - translates to “to taint The Weave”. The vials have a strong necromantic energy. The liquid seems a magical equivalent of acid as if designed to destroy magic items.
	- Soothing piano music plays when [[Ultrin]] sits on the sofa. It sings the [[Kyransalee]] dedicated Drow ritual “Song of Servitude” as part of binding their souls to her forever. 
- There are main stairs leading upwards. They are less grand than you would expect for a mansion. 
- The final room on the floor is an office, setup with a desk and visitors chair. The room is dishevelled, with draws and cabinets left open, parchment everywhere - almost looks ransacked (by someone who knows it well? So just a disorganised person). 
	- On the desk are diplomatic seals and wax, inkwells and official seals of [[Neverwinter]], the ministry of health and the minister of health and the Silhorn family seal (all seem legit).
	- There is a small glass jar on the desk, containing a pulsating fungel fragment (like in the kitchen).
	- Most of the parchment is official documents of health ministry (various authors). Some stacks of parchment have numbered stacks, missing some pages. Some parchments seem unofficial works - describing people, places, business and rumours about them (no health angle). 
	- There is a locked draw of the desk, undisturbed which looks to have been attempted to be forced, but failed and the lock is now damaged. [[Aust]] mends the lock and. [[Merric]] picks it open.
		- Inside is “Evidence” - a forgery set, some half complete forged documents (identities and job descriptions for recruitment to various organisations). Forged ID for a new recruit to grey cloaks and one for enlistment to Raven Queen inquisition. 
		- There are a few scraps of parchment with references to the party - these are very recent. They mention alligencies and rivalries (our investigation, Arlon, Gerrard Way, Tarrith, the stakeout of My Chemical reagents and visiting the High Inquisitor). 
- Heading up the main stairs, leads to an upper landing. The room is underwhelming, with a tiny chandelier (that is swaying in a non-existent draft) and a suit of armour that feels like its watching us. [[Ultrin]] believes it is enchanted with a trigger to cause it to move. 
- Going up the servant stairs leads to a door that leads onto the same upper landing. There is also a small storage space for servants containing a barrel and a create (containing cleaning and repair supplies). 
- Off the hallway is a bedroom that the party sneaks into ([[Jorund]] staying downstairs). The room is orderly but cramped - clearly for servants. There is a lockbox and a simple desk with a ledger and a small wardrobe opposite the bed. 
	- Opening the lockbox is 15gp, a spare uniform and a personal journal. The journal has personal details of the head servant, details feelings, going from undervalued servant through to more recently “the master” is referred to with disdain, as the master seems obsessed with shadows and whispering in the dark - the servant is uncomfortable and seems to hate the employer. 
	- In the wardrobe is a drawer containing a cracked silver broach with a family crest (Likely a family crest of a house - presumably Drow). 
- [[Merric]] unlocks the next door and opens it. Inside is a trophy room, no furniture other than suit of armour and fireplace. Mounted on the walls are 4 preserved heads - tiefling (horns adorned with gold rings), drawn (beard with iron clasps), human (expression frozen in defiance), male Drow (empty eye sockets carved into symbols of [[Kyransalee]]). The armour seems mundane. 
	- The heads are preserved via necromantic magic. There is a magic glow from the fireplace and the room is cold - coming from the fireplace. 
	- [[Aust]] investigates the fireplace, it seems perfectly normal but appears to contain an invisible cold fire. It seems to be draining warmth from the room. 
	- [[Merric]] investigates the heads (with [[Aust]]’s help). The heads seem to have been hacked off violently, not showing the usual meticulous care for a trophy room. The violence of this is at contrast to their presentation. 
	- The Drow head has something carved into the skin beneath their hair - “betrayer”. The scaring seems to have been done before death. The eye sockets were done post mortem.
- The next room is an alchemy workshop, with a bust of a Drow, upon a pedestal covered in tendril growths. There is an alchemical table with many ingredients. There is another sealed jar of fungel spores which is buckling from the pressure. There is parchment on the table and a sink covered in violet fungi. 
	- The parchment is a stack of research notes on 2 themes - [[aromycos]] and fungus in general, describing it as a destructive force of decay and an opportunity, discussing fungal networks being connected; the other theme is into shadows and shadow magic, binding and harnessing shadows for a greater purpose. There is an attempt to link the 2 - growing fungus in dark places and shadows link the fungal network (seems mad).
	- [[Ultrin]] opens a door and takes a bit of damage from a wave of cold and sharp things lodging in his windpipe. Inside is a cracked urn draining the light around it, with fungal growth from ceiling to floor. 
		- [[Merric]] sees [[Ultrin]] chant something in a morbid rhyme chanting a cantrip that shouldn’t exist. [[Merric]] asks about the spell and [[Ultrin]] says is “Pocket full of poses” a completely normal spell, which [[Merric]] thinks [[Ultrin]] doesn’t seem to entirely believe himself. 
		- The urn seems to be designed to consume light and actively create shadow. It is cracked and cold necromantic energy is pulsing out, as if the urn were bleeding (seems damaged). Everywhere except the urn is covered in mould. This seems to match the research notes.
	- The jar with the fungus on the bench has strangely non uniform growth - it is focused downwards. There is a draw beneath it which [[Merric]] opens and finds a shard of black obsidian which faintly consumes light around it - seems to be a perfect patch for the urn, as if manufactured for this. 
		- [[Merric]] slices the shard in half with several strikes of his scimitar. Dark sparks fly off each time it is struck. The shard seems malevolent, making the urn seem dangerous to smash. 
	- The Drow bust is definitely of a Drow (even without colour in the bust). There is a hidden compartment in the pedestal, which is encircled in white tendrils that he doesn’t want to touch.
