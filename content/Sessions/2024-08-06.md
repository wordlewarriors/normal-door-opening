## At the [[Halls of Justice]]
- [[Merric]] asks [[Arlon]] about the locations that [[Ivaran Sylhorn]] visits
	- The shops are owned by independent individuals and don’t appear to have any connections. The shops are successful, but that isn’t suspicious. Not involved in water purification.
	- The fact the places CANT be connected is suspicious.
	- [[Ivaran Sylhorn]] visits the shops either on his way to work or on the way home. Always in the same order, which is the most efficient order for walking to each of them from home/office.
	- Unsure if he has visited today. He goes most days. No strict patterns to how often.

## At [[Alexander’s Mystic Manuscripts]]
- [[Aust]] and [[Merric]] ask [[Ultrin]] about the book of evil. [[Ultrin]] lies about not having it with him and refuses to say way. He seems very shifty about the book.
- We first head to [[Alexander’s Mystic Manuscripts]] to get an idea of how much the book Amulets of Ultimate evil is worth, so [[Ultrin]] can appear better informed at the [[Shrouded Ledger]].
	- [[Ultrin]] is taken to see the proprietor (Mr Alexander) by his grandson (George) and given a history of the store. 
		- Mr Alexander asks where the book came from and says he would need proof of ownership from [[Ultrin]] before he would be happy to purchase it and that he could look to beat offers from other places. The book isn’t in great condition and probably belongs in an occult location. 
		- He notes that it contains methods for ==producing an amulet of ultimate evil.==
		- He suggests it‘s worth 300-400GP but that it would be challenging to sell, unless he sold it to just anyone. Likely worth 325GP as a result. He is given a business card and leaves.
	- [[Aust]] heads to the 2nd floor in search of spell scrolls. There are staff standing at different desks with queues for the different sections rather than self service. 
		- He is served by a youth that tells him that spell scrolls and a scribing service are available.
		- [[Aust]] enquires about lesser restoration (they have 2), around 250GP each, or 450GP for both.
		- Scribing services takes around 24-72h.
		- [[Aust]] buys a heat metal scroll for another 200GP.
		- 3rd level scrolls are 500GP each.
	- [[Merric]] asks the staff if any magical books are sold here and is dismissive of them when there aren’t. He heads to the 2nd floor, sees they sell wizards spellbooks and fancy 1st edition books. Merric goes to the wizard spell book section. 
		- Merric asks about how business is, told its still as busy. They only sell for the good of the city. They don’t sell evil spells (aside from the right reasons). 
		- It is rumoured that most of the spell books that are “leather” bound were created by [[Vecna]], the more terrifying the skin the more powerful it is. The most evil is bound with a human face. These apparently allow [[Vecna]] to sense through these books. 
		- Told that he should NEVER open the book, because this invites in the evil and unless he’s very strong willed at some point the book will take control and then [[Vecna]] can possibly send instructions through the book via writing in it and reading his responses. They contain outlawed magics.
		- It is suggested that [[Merric]] reports the book to the academic misconduct board. 
		- [[Merric]] asks about books that could protect against magical attacks. 
		- [[Merric]] asks about [[Shrouded Ledger]] and is told that they don’t have any scruples about selling evil things or dealing with evil people. Says that there are wanna be necromancies and murders that can be traced back to that shop. 

## At the [[Shrouded Ledger]]
- We head to the [[Shrouded Ledger]], which is set back from the street.
- [[Jorund]] casts invisibility on [[Merric]] while [[Aust]] and [[Ultrin]] go in.
	- The shop is low and dark and dingy. Lit candles illuminate the shop but there are no windows so it is all in shadow. There seems to be on elderly old proprietor ([[Vespar Bookman]]) and there are books lined along all the walls. Some tables have books hovering gently above tables, these seem the more expensive ones.
	- [[Ultrin]] asks to get his book valued. He says he had it valued recently but they didn’t want to buy it. He once again has to explain he was given the book and that he is a member of the academy.
	- Vespar suggests 400GP value and that it would “fly off the shelf”.
	- [[Aust]] plays with spinning the floating books. He asks if books fly off the shelf often. He is told some of the books are sentient and fly off the shelf and leave the store! Sentient books read you while you read them. Reading such a book feels like staring into the eyes of another.
	- [[Ultrin]] asks how many sentient books Vespar has read, is told “more than one” and that he has never lived if he hasn’t read one. They are very disruptive - flying, screaming, whispering. 
	- [[Ultrin]] asks if [[Vespar Bookman]] has a list of people that he notifies when he receives “interesting” (evil) magical tomes. [[Ultrin]] states that he’s independently wealthy but does jobs for [[Lord Neverember]]. He seems very nervous when this is mentioned, as if he should be under arrest for some reason. 
	- [[Aust]] asks how the books spin and is told “levitation”. The pedestals that they sit above are enchanted for this effect. The shop has a no children policy. 
	- One book is the “Arcane codex of Nymyria” (a well known scholar and archmage), it describes the interactions of the elements. It is priced at 7500GP.   
- [[Merric]] goes looking for some way around the back of the shops, finds a lane down the back of many shops. The backs are not labelled, but [[Merric]] decides which one he thinks is the back of the [[Shrouded Ledger]]. There is a wooden door with a lock on it. 
	- [[Merric]] picks the lock and checks for traps/alarms. On opening the door, can see the warding of an alarm spell, such that opening the door too much will trip an alarm. 
	- [[Merric]] climbs onto the roof and finds standing water. There are no skylights or anything interesting on the roof.
	- [[Merric]] tells [[Aust]] that he is going to trip the alarm spell and does this, before hiding on the roof. 
- Vespar asks them both to accompany him to the back door to investigate the alarm spell.
	- [[Aust]] casts detect magic to sweep for magical items. They go past a stock room, the ledge book, etc and the open back door. Vespar is confused that he thought he locked the back door. [[Aust]] goes into the alley and [[Merric]] asks him to distract Vespar.
- [[Merric]] sneaks in the front of the shop and re locks the front door. 
	- Looking around the back of the shop there is a storage room and office. There is a writing desk with stacked papers and a seal of the business. The writing desk has a couple of draws. One draw has a ledger detailing shop trades. 
	- [[Merric]] unlocks the other draw and finds a small money safe, deeds to the building and a set of keys. The money safe is too complex to open. 
	- [[Merric]] scans the ledger for key words - nothing mentioning my chemical reagents, Neverember, many transactions by [[Ivaran Sylhorn]] every few days he buys or sells a book. The books are not related to the job, they are on illusion, dark arts, curses, poisons, hexes, mystical healing, folk tales of healing. No strong consistent theme. 
	- [[Merric]] scans the letters and the deeds and finds nothing interesting. He also looks at the seal so he can recognise it in the future. 
	- [[Merric]] sneaks back out the front, re-locks it and joins [[Jorund]] (invisibly).
- Everyone meets up around the corner in the Main Street.
