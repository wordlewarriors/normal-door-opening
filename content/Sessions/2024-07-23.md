- We head back to [[Neverwinter Manor]]. [[Edgar]] makes tea.
- We recap our findings and go to bed
	- [[Merric]] reads the manual for 6h on his first day (6 of 48/1 of 6)

## Merric’s room
- [[Merric]] has strange dreams. He is seated at a grand wooden dining table in a tavern. The room is dimly lit by candles, casting long shadows on the walls which are downed with hunting trophies and paintings of adventurers. [[Merric]] can smell spiced meats and freshly baked bread and also ale. Around the table are set friends, members of his tribe, [[Verna]], [[Jungo]] (not [[Ortho]]). Everyone looks happy and healthy and are sharing food. Everything feels too perfect. It feels like being home.
	- There is a person serving the table and refilling bowels, refilling mugs, etc. Their mannerisms seem very Drow like although outwardly appear human. 
	- A well dressed Elf walks in and sits at the head of the table and toasts the group. [[Merric]] its good to see you amongst your loved ones, Ive come to offer you a chance to reclaim your joy and companionship you see before you. The food and drink glows with an ethereal light and there is the feeling of magic reasonating from it. “Our world is changing. Our mother and father herald a new era, one where pain is transformed into power, death into eternal life. Your family have embraced this gift” [[Merric]] catches something in his eyes that unsettles him in the elf’s eyes, a deep malevolence. 
	- The elf waves his hand and the tavern shifts, making the walls of the tavern pulsate as if in a living being. The food now has an almost fungal quality and almost seems as if it’s both deteriorating and also fungal. 
	- The silverware of the table have subtle and tasteful spider like patterns on them. They seem more polished than is possible. In a gathering of the tribe there would be side conversations just happening but something about how this is happening seems off, as if using a different gift to communicate directly.
	- The elf says “Join us [[Merric]], embrace this power and together we can reshape this world in the image of our mother and father. Your family will never know pain again and you will be part of something greater than yourself. You will never again be without them and they will never be without you. Will you join us and save them or let them fall to decay.” Everyone stares at Merric.
	- [[Merric]] walks along the table and walking feels less natural than it should, as if being allowed when he goes to make an unexpected move. [[Merric]] lobs a bread roll at [[Jungo]] who catches it, but gives the impression of being part of someone else’s dream. 
	- [[Merric]] asks what mother and father want. “They wish to usher a new era, where pain becomes power. Where un-death is no longer a curse but a blessing. To be with those you love, forever.” [[Merric]] asks about [[Urlogan]] and is told he is of the old world. [[Merric]] asks about the price and is told some must die, but in the new world death is a blessing that frees us. [[Merric]] asks if he will meet mother and father and is told he will meet them. [[Merric]] pushes the family angle. It is father who is around us, with the creatures of the night, mother is in the underdark. [[Merric]] is told the battle with the [[aromycos]] is spectacular. 
	- [[Merric]] asks what joining would mean and he would be given important assignments within and outside the city and would live eternal as one. Joining grants a say in who may join and who remains a part. What will happen to everyone and everything you love if you don’t join us. It doesn’t have to be a fight. Even his travelling companions if they would swear. 
	- [[Merric]] asks about the benefits and is told there are few of “us” and the city has not yet fallen. The city is strong because of the people within it. The first mission would be to change that and ensure the city falls. 
	- [[Merric]] asks who tops the list of execution and is told the academy must fall. Not much would be required to aid father’s infestation to penetrate the academy and ensure it runs riot. 
	- “I know a lot about you - like everything. Except whether you will accept this offer. You have great darkness within you and have the power to wield death itself, but why wield it, when you can be it. You are one of us”
	- [[Merric]] tells the elf he is disappointed and goes to stab [[Verna]] but then every muscle in this body seizes into paralysis. The mood drains out of the room and everything goes bitter and smells of fungus and rot. The elf paces the table. “How very disappointing” He pulls a strange ethereal strand out of the back of a clan member. “You see, everything you hold dear” and clicks his fingers and the strand explodes. He walks towards [[Jungo]] “Everyone and everything that you love… the family that you strive to protect… those who depend on you….they hang by a thread, a strand.” He walks behind [[Merric]] and reaches over the shoulder to pull a thread from [[Verna]]. “We are this strand, this thread that holds them here” He cuts Verna’s thread and he reaches for something in [[Merric]], as [[Merric]] reaches out to the spell plague in his head, but cant reach it. [[Merric]]’s vision fades to black as he hears one last whisper “you will be destroyed”. [[Merric]] wakes up and puts his dog statue on the night stand to watch him. It is very quiet down in the room but there is some noise from the city, so it’s the middle of the night. [[Merric]] eventually falls back to sleep, uninterrupted.
## Ultrin’s room
- [[Ultrin]] pulls a human leather bound book in his room to read it. Before he knows it, it’s suddenly morning. He awakes in bed feeling like he had a good sleep. The book is not in his hands.

## [[Neverwinter Manor|Veilgard Manor]]
- In the morning, [[Ultrin]] is first up for breakfast (after [[Edgar]]).
- No correlation between the warehouses owned by the Leonard family and the places visited by the Health Minister [[Ivaran Sylhorn]].
	- [[Ultrin]] has met him at social gatherings between [[Neverwinter Academy]] and the [[Council of Neverwinter]]. He has a keen interest in water purification achieved through magical means. [[Neverwinter]] has magically charged crystals in the sewers that are used to purify the water of disease and not spew toxic waste into [[Neverwinter]] bay.
	- [[Ultrin]] knows that the crystals are maintained via a collaborative project between the Druids and the [[Neverwinter Academy]] funded by [[Council of Neverwinter]] 
- [[Merric]] asks [[Aust]] if elves dream while meditating. He is told there are different practises. Aust is less interested in the dreaming bit.
	- [[Merric]] tells [[Aust]] the offer was tempting, [[Aust]] finds this interesting. [[Aust]] wonders if the guy was desperate. 
	- [[Aust]] wonders if any tracks were left. We might have to ask the wizards.
	- [[Merric]] asks [[Ultrin]] about dreams and is told about the #Dream spell that can be used to shape dreams as the caster sees fit if they are on the same plane of existence. The caster can make the dream terrifying to the point of physical harm - this is more effective if the caster has a trinket associated with the target. 
	- [[Ultrin]] knows of protective wards that could protect against the dream but they aren’t common. Sleeping on another plane would also keep you safe.
- We walk to the [[Halls of Justice]] via back roads so we can walk past the 4-5 places the minister visits within the protector’s enclave.
	- ==The [[shrouded ledger]] - book shop==
	- ==[[Whispering vials]] - alchemist==
	- ==[[Gilded Locket]] - jewelry==
	- ==[[Raven’s nest]] - self storage==
	- ==A probably residential location==
		- Walking past, this looks residential. Looks like a block of 3-4 apartments, possibly shop keepers homes, just jammed in where there’s space. It doesn’t appear abandoned.

## At the Halls of Justice
- We arrive at the [[Halls of Justice]] - there is no [[Drow Spy]] on the rooftop, but there is a lack of people in the area - this feels odd. There is the remains of a pillar of smoke coming from deeper inside the protector’s enclave. 
	- We are directed to the armoury to find [[Aarlon]]. He is present with a mix of Greycloaks and Nashers, gathering a number of supplies to re supply the armed forces on the streets.
	- [[My Chemical Reagents]] has been burned down. The guy watching it wasn’t noticed. A Drow had arrived and went into the shop and when they came out the shop was on fire. 
- [[Merric]] walks off in a huff with [[Aarlon]] and then the group goes to the cells to visit the Drow prisoner while [[Jorund]] fills [[Aarlon]] in on what we found at the Leonard mansion.
	- We arrive at some fancy, well lit cells. We look into the cell and see a painfully bright room light by ever burning torches and a Drow that appears asleep - this appears to be [[Tarrith]]. He asks if we are here to free him from this place, otherwise they will kill him.
	- [[Jorund]] asks what [[Tarrith]] was doing last night. He claims he was under the employ of [[Lord Neverember]] (personally) and was instructed to burn down [[My Chemical Reagents]]. He believes it was a setup that he was caught, but doesn’t deny it. 
	- There is some truth in what he was saying - but he was 100% not employed by [[Lord Neverember]] and he hesitated on thinking of his name.
	- [[Ultrin]] casts suggestion on [[Tarrith]] to tell him to speak the truth and [[Tarrith]] says it was actually someone with [[Lord Neverember]]’s seal, that he doesn’t interact with personally but gets instructions via dead drops. [[Tarrith]] is MORE for hire than before. He is upset that he has been caught twice in a fortnight and that whenever he works against us it goes wrong. 
	- [[Merric]] can tell that [[Tarrith]] is still concealing something, but this seems to be his training. [[Merric]] tells this to [[Jorund]] telepathically
	- [[Jorund]] asks the others to give him and [[Tarrith]] some space while he tries to terrify & threaten him (which fails). [[Jorund]] asks [[Tarrith]] to just speak the plain truth, is told that he will never disclose who did the job (but the bit with the seal was true). 
	- [[Tarrith]] tells us he wont tell us the information about the dead drop and the time. He would tell us before he dies, but he seems to be protecting someone -this must be family, or maybe god.
	- [[Merric]] asks [[Aarlon]] to bring back [[Tarrith]]’s effects. 
		- [[Ultrin]] finds a spider web marking on the hilt of his blade.
		- His gold has gone to the city treasury.
	- [[Merric]] threatens to force feed [[Tarrith]] a tainted health potion and turn him undead. He is protecting his brother who is also in the city - [[Nym]], he is also a merc. 
	- [[Merric]] asks [[Tarrith]] what he thinks of [[House T’sarran]] - he recognises the name as [[Kyransalee]] worshippers and believe that men of family are stronger as undead, so they send the men of the family into battle to die and be raised. 
	- [[Jorund]] convinces [[Tarrith]] to tell us that [[Nym]] is employed by same people as him and that they have the same cover story, but opposite. They are identical twins. 
	- [[Tarrith]] has been getting jobs for weeks. 
	- [[Aarlon]] tells us that his man is currently sleeping at the [[Beach Leviathan]] ((where the displaced Orcs have been put up as bouncers)).
	- [[Tarrith]] tells us where he can meet with [[Nym]] - go to trade house and first auction of the day, we can find him there (he wont be bidding, he will be hiding in shadows. [[Tarrith]] told us to tell [[Nym]] the story about killing the chosen of [[Kyransalee]] and that we are friends.
