#Neverwinter 
## At [[Neverdeath Graveyard]]
- The pre-sunrise streets are busy with those trying to get ahead of the day, its loud for a city locked own over night
- There is a large pyre in [[Neverdeath Graveyard]], with guards of many factions tending it.
- We knock at the door for the [[Neverwinter Temple of the Raven Queen]] and are let in by an unfamiliar Raven Queen guard.
	- We are told that sometimes the undead fought at night were healthy during the day. 
- [[Aust]] finds signs that there is fresh rust around the trapdoor, with signs of sharp claws trying to resist going into the hole.
	- [[Merric]] finds the rust is likely from a corrosive liquid splashed on the metal. He can hear whispering sounding like it's coming from under the trapdoor - something like the whispers of the [[Spellplague]].
	- We are told that the [[High Inquisitor]] gets back around 30min before others, and he has now been back for around 1h.
- We knock on the door and the whispers stop. A tired looking [[High Inquisitor]] emerges. He looks deeply scared from the [[Sangrullo]] attack and is wearing his ceremonial robes.
	- [[Merric]] forces the [[High Inquisitor]] back down the ladder into the room below, emerging into a 10x10 room.  Behind the ladder are various desks piled high with vials, reagents and notes.
	- [[Jorund]] tells the [[High Inquisitor]] that he killed all the undead in the [[Shadowfell]].
- [[Merric]] stealthily checks out the desks while [[Ultrin]] grabs on of the [[High Inquisitor]]'s loose hairs. [[Merric]] looks at some fresh notes and finds a sort of diary / official report of the night - where the trouble started, the death toll (undead and lost defenders). It appears to be his personal notes for his recall. The notes are incomplete and any older ones are missing.
- The [[High Inquisitor]] notes to [[Jorund]] that he has also felt his connection to the [[Raven Queen]] weakening at times. He says that the pattern of infection of the #plague  seems to be random.
	- [[Merric]] makes the sound of the [[Spellplague]] whispers in the head of the [[High Inquisitor]] - he looks confused for a moment and moves as if he were dropping concentration from a spell.
- The alchemical reagents appear to include materials for divination
- [[Jorund]] learns the [[High Inquisitor]] often heals diseased worms that hit him by prying (using cure disease). The [[High Inquisitor]] tells us that [[Neverwinter]] is losing around 100 people per night.
- The [[High Inquisitor]] has been using magic to read thoughts of the undead, but if he pushes too deep they die.

## At [[My Chemical Reagents]]
- The party heads to [[My Chemical Reagents]] and find the shop windows full of stuck and new stock. The dragon heart is still present.
- [[Jerrard]] seems to be honestly surprised that the Drow records from the [[Shadowfell Market]] lead to him.
- He mentioned that people with seals of [[Lord Neverember]] turned up and asked him to store some creates baring the seal. We demand that he show us and takes us to see 4-5 wooden crates.
	- The wooden creates and their seals look legit, all look fresh, have a matching lock and have either the official seal or a very good forgery.
	- [[Jerrard]] tells us that he has been offered a tax rebate to hold onto these. An elven man started to drop them off over 1 and a half weeks ago and they have been collected over the same period. The last visit was 3d ago. 
	- Someone usually comes at the end of the day and [[Jerrard]] suspects that he is letting himself in through the back goods door.
	- [[Ultrin]] detects many sources of Evocation magic - potentially healing potions
- [[Merric]] unlocks the top create and finds it contains around 40 healing potions across 2 layers. These potions are the wrong colour - they look watered down.
	- [[Ultrin]] confirms that these potions would work as a weak healing potion but that they also each contain tiny translucent orbs which appear non-magical. They look like eggs.
- The party bought 25k worth of diamonds for 23k.
- [[Merric]] extracted one of the eggs from one of the suspect healing potions which contained 2 eggs.
