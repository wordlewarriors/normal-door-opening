#Neverwinter 
## In [[Neverwinter Academy]]
* We told [[Nand]] that [[Ultrin]] had been reading forbidden books. [[Ultrin]] was told to read the  book [[Talismans of Ultimate Evil]] which would hep him understand how to deal with the an evil artefact.
	* The talisman that we found in the [[House of Screams]] symbolises pure evil
	* Creature has to be pure evil to even hold it, otherwise they are rejected
	* If good, big ouch
	* Evil clerics/paladins can use as holy symbol, will empower them
	* Can open flaming fissures below good folk, where they are disappeared as if they never existed.
	* We put it in bag of holding
* As payment to [[Nand]], [[Ultrin]] give 500G, [[Jorund]] promised two secrets from the [[House of Knowledge]] and [[Merric]] promised to hand over the Book of Quickness of Action once he's finished it
* Make plan to go to the [[House of Knowledge]], then to manor for a nap, before heading to Raven Queen for dawn

## At the [[House of Knowledge]]
* We head to the [[House of Knowledge]]. Along the way the streets are mostly empty. The House is a shrine to [[Oghma]], with a skylight illuminating the centre of the interior of the shrine. It appears very quiet as if people have gone home. There is a drawfen faithful to [[Oghma]] whistling as he cleans, this is [[Big John]] (the cleaner), who is known to [[Ultrin]]. 
	* [[Big John]] tells us that many of the male clergy are massively corrupt and that most of [[Ultrin]]'s friends have been excommunicated.
	* [[Jorund]] asks [[Big John]] why [[Ultrin]] couldn't see the map and was told there are many reasons. 
	* [[Big John]] tells us that there is an island off the coast of [[Chult]] called [[Wormcrawl]], where the necromancer [[Kyusse]] found a dead cult which he brought back to enable his ascent. [[House of Knowledge]] hides this from wizards as they are worried they'll do the same
	* [[Jorund]] suggests to [[Big John]] that he could come back with a girl if that would help get the map.
* We go to speak to the head of the maps department, [[Janice]], who is also known to [[Ultrin]]. After [[Jorund]] is nearly successful in sweet talking his way past her, [[Ultrin]] casts invisibility but is clumsy and gives away his presence, making [[Janice]] angry and untrusting so she refuses to share the map. 
	* [[Jorund]] is told that if he returns with a note from the high inquisitor of the [[Raven Queen]] then he will be allowed to see the map.
	* [[Merric]] believes that [[Ultrin]] may not want to be a #lich right now, but may be tempted to become one later

## At the [[Neverwinter Manor]]
* We head home, to find that it is very well maintained.
	* here we met [[Edgar]] again. He is now alone here and offers is condolences to [[Merric]], telling him that the graves are at the back. Here [[Merric]] finds the graves of [[Verna]] and [[other servant]]
* [[Ultrin]] introduces himself and [[Jorund]] to [[Edgar]] (both having never met him) and thanks him for his work. [[Edgar]] admits that despite rejecting many bribes, the prisoner ([[Tarrith]]) eventually escaped.
* [[Edgar]] tells [[Jorund]] that a letter has arrived for the party and he opens it. The seal is a deep blue circular insignia with 9 symboles and an arcane sigil. 
	* The letter is from the [[Circle of 9s]] and asks to meet on any odd numbered day. It claims security is paramount. There is an enclosed signal as a symbol of intent. 
	* No time is given but the meeting place is recognised by [[Ultrin]] as a famous bar/theatre. 
	* This group seems to be somehow related to the [[Harpers]]
