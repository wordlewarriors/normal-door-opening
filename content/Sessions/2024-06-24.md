## In the [[Halls of Justice]]
- [[Lord Neverember]] feels there's a greater meaning to everything and that the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] will save [[Neverwinter]]
	- [[General Sabine]] wants to charge the [[Sky Spawn]]. They successfully killed one of the beats - taking 20men and losing 3-4 of them.
	- [[Aarlon]] thinks there is corruption within the council of [[Neverwinter]] and he is assigned with watching the council.
	- [[Aarlon]] uses thieves cant to try and send a message to [[Merric]], but he cant quite make it out. As he does this he looks to be in pain and starts to get a nose bleed.
- We ask [[Lord Neverember]] for our promised payment. He seems unwilling and instead suggests that he would pay us even more for also saving the universe.
- We are told that [[Aarlon]] had been imprisoned following his assassination attempt. At his request in order to save the city, he had been put under a Geas for 30d to "Serve Neverwinter", as set by the academy (most likely by [[Nand]]). He suffers actual pain if he goes against it.
- [[Lord Neverember]] tells us that a few potions (around 2-10) are used every night, with [[Neverwinter Academy]] refilling the stock on demand.
- The party explains what it knows of the [[Starspawn of Nihal]]
- [[Lord Neverember]] tells us that the [[Tarrith]] is still around and seems to be following him.
- There are 8 people on the [[Council of Neverwinter]]:
![[Council of Neverwinter]]
- The old Minister of Defence fell in battle, leading from the front, fighting the [[Starspawn of Nihal]]
- We are told that there are many entrances to the [[Underdark]] in the forest nearby
- We learn that the [[White Sails]] are from [[Minton]] - a place of great ship building, much of which seems to be funded by [[Lord Neverember]]'s personal wealth.
- After this discussion, the party heads to the armoury with [[Aarlon]].
	- [[Aarlon]] thinks that the corrupt counsellor possibly hired the [[Tarrith]] to keep watch on [[Lord Neverember]]
	- [[Aarlon]] is suspicious of the Minister for Health ([[Ivaran Sylhorn]]) and the Minister for Trade ([[Amelia Briar]]). They visit houses that aren't their own on their way home - a whole set of houses between them.
	- [[Aarlon]] has yet to have any of the houses searched - don't want to tip them off.[[Aarlon]] points out and marks the houses on our map. One is in the Protector's enclave (a mansion like ours, not too far from our own) and 4-5 places doted around storage buildings, shops and residences.
	- [[Amelia Briar]] spends 1h at the mansion while [[Ivaran Sylhorn]] spends around 5-10 min. 
	- Both of the ministers have a gated mansion within the Protector's enclave. 
	- The mansion that [[Lady Elara Swiftsong]] visits is owned by the Leonard family of merchants. 
	- Agreed with [[Aarlon]] that some of his limited resources will be spent on watching [[My Chemical Reagents]] in return for the party investigating these 2 ministers.
- [[Merric]] climbed up onto the rooftop opposite the [[Halls of Justice]] where he saw the [[Tarrith]] and leaves a note to him - "Meet us at the mansion".
