- The area around the false floor is obviously staged, but everything else looks disused. Most of the alchemical ingredients look to be expired.
- We all meet up at the [[Broken Cask]], discuss what we found and head out into a back alley for a bit of privacy. [[Ultrin]] casts Identify on the key: it is used to unlock a lock. The magic in the key was created with a ritual involving sacrifice (hence the necromancy) so the key contains life-force (but isn’t sentient). 

## Headed to A Probably Residential Location

> Walking past, this looks residential. Looks like a block of 3-4 apartments, possibly shop keepers homes, just jammed in where there’s space. It doesn’t appear abandoned.

- The streets are becoming deserted with the curfew drawing near. In a window of a townhouse is a thin unhealthy (malnourished) human man with slicked back greasy hair, he is smoking and watching us suspiciously. 
- [[Jorund]] reminds the man of the curfew and tells him he should close the window. The man seems suspicious of seeing an official patrol, thinks people don’t care about such a poor area. 
	- [[Jorund]] senses that the mean is eager to leave the conversation when pressed about anyone official. [[Jorund]] casts Charm Person on the man (he fails the save) who tells him that there is a speak easy in the basement, and the man is a lookout for the establishment but he would totally let [[Jorund]] in so long as he doesn’t tell anyone. He is happy for everyone to go in.
	- [[Merric]] finds nameplates on some of the buildings (not all of them have names in). He doesn’t find any names he recognises. 
	- As he opens the door, the spell wares off and [[Merric]] knocks him out cold and shuffles him into the building. 
	- As everyone enters the building, inside is a wooden stairwell leading up and down. There is a smell of damp and must, it seems like a not affluent, not well kept place. People may have been urinating in the stairwell.
	- There is the sound of some echoing music coming from the basement. 
	- [[Aust]] and [[Merric]] go upstairs and find he left the door to a house open. It is very dirty, every single dish, cup and plate is piled up on a table and there are countless empty bottles of spirits and cigarette butts everywhere. There is no one else home. 
	- [[Merric]] finds a jewellery box with a few gold pieces in it. [[Merric]] adds 4 more GP. 
	- We tied up the unconscious man and left him in his room.
- Heading down the stairwell, there is a hatch with a metal ring to open it. [[Merric]] opens it and [[Jorund]] leads the way down a slightly rotten (but very strong) wooden ladder. There are dimly flickering candles illuminating the room. The room is filled with smoke. There are 3 humanoid people. 
	- [[Jorund]] asks for the barman and the music abruptly stops, he is told the barman is out running an errand. He is asked if he is one of Rat’s friends and says yes. [[Aust]] jumps into the room and says he is too. The man tells them to help themselves. 
	- There is a table at the far side of the room with many spirits and vats on it. It doesn’t look like a business, more like alcoholics. There is a table to help yourself with a pot of ale bubbling away and smelling cheap and potent. There is some strangely viscous ”red wine”, a bottle labelled “rum” and a bottled filled with a strange translucent liquid.
	- [[Jorund]] pours half a flagon of “rum”. [[Ultrin]] and [[Merric]] enter the room.
	- There is an old man with a beard, a burley woman with a buzz cut and a scar down her face (Lyra) and a ghostly white woman who’s watching everything curiously. 
	- The room looks like it was once an underground pantry, about 15x25ft. It’s not big enough for 7 people to relax in.
	- [[Aust]] asks about how to pay - he’s told there’s a pot beside the ale. He is told some of the liqueur is made, some is procured. The payment pot has a mix of copper and silver. 
	- The man asks [[Jorund]] what brings him here. He says he’s here for the booze, says it takes the pain away. [[Jorund]] asks about the pale woman - he’s told that she drinks the pale milky water is called “==widow’s kiss==” and it leaves an empty feeling in the chest. They make it from “anything, fruits and stuff”.
	- The man tells [[Jorund]] he thinks Rat was last here yesterday, but it’s all a bit of a blur. Sometimes he donates stuff or gives a bit of money - he mostly just lets them be. Rat doesn’t drink (around these people). 
	- The old man tells [[Jorund]] that Lyra likes to drink the “rum” which is very potent.
	- [[Jorund]] says we’re here to pick some stuff up for him - is told when Rat or his partners arrive they make the drunks clear out for a bit (10-15min). Usually people arrive before they get this drunk.
	- [[Jorund]] and [[Aust]] help the 3 people to head upstairs after the room is slightly tidied up. [[Merric]] follows the old man up the stairs (stealthily). The women go quietly back to their own flats. The party returns to the basement.
	- [[Jorund]] finds that behind the table that holds the alcohol are bookshelves that are empty. The wall behind the bookshelves is different - it’s metal instead of brick. There is a metal door carved with faintly glowing green runes. The door makes him feel mildly ill when standing near it. 
	- [[Merric]] finds warding glyphs similar to the lock box, but they are bigger (unsure if larger object or more powerful).
	- [[Ultrin]] identifies this as a Glyph of Warding, but is unsure what the specific trigger is. The Glyph has hints of necromantic magic. [[Aust]] detects the door glowing with conjuration and necromancy, while the lock is just necromantic.
	- [[Ultrin]] unlocks the door with the key. [[Aust]] casts pass without trace and opens the door.
	- As the door opens there is a stench of rot and the air is warm. ==Everyone except [[Aust]] is gagging from the smell (functionally poisoned)==. [[Aust]] sees [[Ultrin]] reach into his robe and pull out some dried dead rose petals, crush him and mutter under his breath. Via detect magic, [[Aust]] sees a dark shadowy aura around [[Ultrin]] as he appears to have subconsciously cast a warding spell on himself.
- Beyond the door is a 10x10ft room lined with shelves full to the brim with glass jars containing greenish-red liquid, eggs, worms and larvae. In the center of the room is a grotesque hatchery, with a central tank filled with the greenish-red liquid. This is thinker than the liquid in the jar and is full of worms. Some of the liquid and worms from the central tank have spilled over onto the floor (causing some worms to perish). There are tubes and pumps attached to the central tank. It is decidedly not natural. 
	- There doesn’t seem to be any attachment to the sewers.
	- The live worms on the floor seem docile. The ones in the liquid seem much more active. There is a lid to the tank. 
	- [[Aust]] checks the room and finds stacks of wooden crates. He opens one and finds it contains tainted healing potions. These are marked with 
	- [[Ultrin]] looks at some other crates and finds what look to be a couple of hundred normal healing potions. 
	- This is conclusive proof of a source of potions.
- We move the untainted healing potions out of the room. Behind the tank is a work bench with bloodied parchment, badly soaked with reddish green liquid. There are arcane signals on the workbench, marking it as an enchanter’s workstation. 
	- [[Ultrin]] checks out the workbench and finds a ritual circle on it, along with a strange singe that he’s not seen before. 
	- [[Aust]] looks at the parchment and finds it is some kind of old map of [[Neverwinter]] with 4 locations circled. There is a scrawled note on the back about convergence of the 4 locations. 
	- The cross that joins the locations looks to be at [[Ivaran Sylhorn]]’s manor.
- We remove all the occupants from the building and then [[Ultrin]] uses fireball to explode the bombs left by [[Merric]] and [[Jorund]]. Everything in the laboratory area is destroyed and the fire spreads out into the outer room, where the moonshine explodes and adds to the fire.
