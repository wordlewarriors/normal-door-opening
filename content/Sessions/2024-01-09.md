#Neverwinter 
## Heading to [[Neverdeath Graveyard]]
- [[Jorund]] and [[Merric]] head to [[Neverdeath Graveyard]]. The graveyard is busy, with lots of people visiting, many funeral processions and those looking for blessings for undisturbed rest should they fall to the sickness
- Approaching the doors of the  [[Neverwinter Temple of the Raven Queen]], spotted a crowd of people waiting outside the temple, waiting for someone to come out so that they can make desperate pleas for help. 
	- To avoid the crush we find a quieter door around the back and had a chat with [[â€˜olland]] a member of the [[Raven Queen]] staff. [[Jorund]] gave him a +1 great sword. 
	- Learned that the High Inquisitor (head of this temple) [[Eye Omniscient]] has started taking a live infected member of the townsfolk down to the basement each night and is not sharing any information about this.
	- We check out the trapdoor into the basement as [[Eye Omniscient]] sleeps during the day. Despite no obvious locks we cannot get the door open and assume it is magically locked.
	- [[Jorund]] is given a key to the [[Neverwinter Temple of the Raven Queen]].

## Return to [[Neverwinter Academy]]
- [[Jorund]] and [[Merric]] return to [[Neverwinter Academy]] and meet [[Ultrin]]. Together we learn about the [[Sangrullo]] from [[Nand]]. The [[Sangrullo]]'s lair is likely to be on a hidden island on a map that [[Nand]] couldn't get access to a the [[House of Knowledge]]. 
- We tasked [[Nand]] with researching [[Machanis]],  the [[The Fraternity of Order]], the [[Fortress of Disciplined Enlightenment]] and [[Layer 222 of the abyss]]
