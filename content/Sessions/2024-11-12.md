- The 3 patrons are sitting outside looking drunk. The bearded man is the only one that seems aware and seems upset. 
	- There is the sound of running footsteps running towards us from the dark alley - it is 2 robed individuals (Academic robes), one holding a horn and deciding whether to blow it
	- Everyone from the party goes into the shadows of nearby buildings, except [[Jorund]] who gets left behind.
	- [[Jorund]] leaves them to discuss what should be done to put the fire out. 
	- The party meet up around the corner

## Heading to [[Ivaran Sylhorn]]’s manor
- 2 story mansion, detached with own grounds which are walled. Large metal gates. Mansion has gothic architecture and many spikes.  No signs of life, no lights and no smoke from chimneys
- Circling the exterior wall, it is very well kept. There is only 1 gate to the property and only 1 door. The manhole covers have been unused for a long time, a few look like they could be crowbarred open. 
- [[Merric]] produces a crowbar, [[Jorund]] opens the manhole and the sewer smells surprisingly not unpleasant. [[Ultrin]] climbs down the ladder into a walkway next to sludge. They attempt to find a way to underneath the manor.
- [[Merric]] and [[Aust]] stay on guard at the front of the mansion. 
- The entrance to the sewer was very clean, but under the mansion there is evidence of spider webs. 
- While exploring the sewer, [[Ultrin]] is grabbed from behind and is wrapped up in webs. 
	- The spider bites [[Ultrin]] in the lower back and its acid starts to eat away at his armour. There is a blue glowing rune on the thorax.
	- [[Ultrin]] uses thunderstep to escape, causing a very loud thunderous sound to echo through the sewers.
	- The spider runs towards [[Jorund]], who flees it to climb the ladder to get ready to lift the manhole cover
	- [[Ultrin]] hits the spider with toll the dead and then runs down the sewer
	- [[Jorund]] is hit by the spider as it chases after him. He replies with a thunderous smite, thrusting the spider down to the floor. 
	- [[Ultrin]] hits the spider with thunderous smite. 
	- [[Merric]] climbs down the ladder to attempt to finish the spider off  but misses. He retreats and they close the manhole cover.
- The lights in the manor have gone out and the guards are approaching. Some men in robes and some people in dark leather armour. 
- Inspecting the gate, [[Merric]] finds it trapped with programmed illusion, but opens it anyway. An illusion of an ethereal elvish man appears, staring and then says “Umm, the manor is under observation from the governing body of Neverwinter, the academy and private mercenaries. If you breach the perimeter they will be alerted immediately.”
	- [[Jorund]] thinks the illusion was of the minister and [[Ultrin]] is sure it is, having met him
	- [[Merric]] heads up to the manor front door. The grounds of the manor are well kept. There are grand double doors and metal knockers on each door in the shape of lions heads. 
	- [[Jorund]] knocks at the door and there is an unsettling echo from the manor, as if the echo is somehow being reflected and the manor is being protected. [[Aust]] can see crows circling around the manor.
- [[Aust]] dispels the magic lock and [[Merric]] eventually picks the lock open (after a few min)
- Immediately inside is a small cloak room and then another door. Beyond this door is a grand foyer, 35ft square, with a long rug and a dusty chandelier. There are large cobwebs in the corners of the room and there are net curtains made of spider silk. There are 6 other doors leading out, all closed.
