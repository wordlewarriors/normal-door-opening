#Neverwinter 
## Walking through [[Neverwinter]] heading to Tower District
- [[Merric]] buys a crappy looking cloak to hide his fancy gear and [[Aust]] casts pass without trace to try and ensure we are not followed. as we head to the tower district and the [[Fallen Tower]].
	- After getting past the bouncer we head into a room with booths lining the walls and a central "stage" with a fence around it and a hole in the ceiling. There is a bar to one side.
	- [[Aust]] sees a slender woman with long black hair wearing a hooded robe. She doesn't fit in with the crowd and is watching us.
	- We go to the bar and meet a halfling barkeep with an impressive moustache. We buy a bottle of fire wine - which results in the drinker belching fire after the first sip. The others go over and grab a booth while [[Merric]] goes to talk to the woman.
	- [[Merric]] notices that she recognised his [[Harpers]] pin, but she seems unmoved until he mentions circles, at which point she joins the party at the booth.
	- She shows off her #spell-scar and tells of her knowledge of those below and above her. They report to the [[Council of 11]]. They watch and report on everything they see. The assumption is that the [[Council of 11]] consists of 11 people across 11 cities.
	- The woman says that the members of her group use their #spell-scar to communicate with each other, but recently they have become fainter and there has been interference. In order to learn how to decode the whispers of the #spell-scar, those of the [[Circle of 9s]] have gone into the great [[Chasm]] in [[Neverwinter]] - which is itself a huge #spell-scar . It either accepts you or rejects you, resulting in possible death.
	- She had been instructed to approach our group to induct us (by telling us to visit the chasm). [[Jorund]] and [[Merric]] aren't terribly impressed.

## Heading to the [[Halls of Justice]]
- We decide to recruit help from [[Aarlon]] to get someone to keep an eye on [[My Chemical Reagents]]. To get to the [[Halls of Justice]] we walk past the [[Chasm]].
- As we walk past the [[Chasm]] [[Merric]]'s #spell-scar  starts to whisper again. Even using comprehend languages isn't enough to be able to understand. 
- As we reach the Protector's Enclave we find it shut down for the night. The different groups of fighters are out and about. 
	- On a rooftop opposite the [[Halls of Justice]] we spot a dark elven figure who seems surprised to see us spotting them and takes off.
	- We loop around the block but see no further sign of the figure.
- The [[Lords' Alliance]] figures let us into the [[Halls of Justice]] and we head to the throne room. Here, [[Lord Neverember]], [[General Sabine]] and [[Aarlon]] are present, standing over a map of the city covered in figures.
	- The dynamic with [[Aarlon]] seems odd - like a junior partner
	- [[Lord Neverember]] has a fresh looking gnarly scar down one side of his face.
