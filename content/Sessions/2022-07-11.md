* Plane 222 (from Izz's vision) might be a layer of [[The Abyss]] Green and sludgy
* We might need to go to [[The Farm Realm]] it was red crackly
* Prime Material was getting all the sludge
* Use disguise kit on Izz to make him undead
* Go off to kill [[The Forge Master]]
* Convince the wee guys this is all going to be ok
* Gormansha, SmutGorger, Rash Hunter, Trash Geezer (Danny Dyer), Scourge Gulper (The Council Ghouls)
* Much planning.  Decide to go in a window
