## Heading to the [[Whispering Vials]]
- [[Aust]] casts detect magic and agrees to go round the back of the shop to deal with any alarm spell.
- Slightly quieter shop, with a hand painted wooden sign and dusty windows. The door is open and the business is running. Some items in the window are magical ingredients. 
- [[Merric]] and [[Aust]] go in the direction of a deliveries entrance that [[Aust]] spots. They head down an alley on the right of the shop and reach an uninviting plain wooden back door. The shop is quite deep and is ~20ft / 2 stories high. It has no windows in the back half of the shop. The back door is locked but not trapped. The handle is low down on the door (as if for a shorter race)
- [[Jorund]] and [[Ultrin]] go in the front of the shop. Inside are many herbs, reagents, plants, insects, etc of an Alchemist shop. The proprietor, [[the man]], is a small gnomish man, bald, with a twirled moustache, sat on a very tall footstool. 
	- [[Jorund]] tells [[Thistle SpindleWhisk]] he has many ailments that he needs help with, but [[the man]] says the place isn’t a hospital and asks if he has a diagnosis. 
	- [[Jorund]] tells [[the man]] he comes from the [[Purple Rocks]] island chain. The shop keep grew up in the forest but there wasn’t much money there. [[the man]] explains that he grows all his own produce as he cant get any imports currently - he explains that this means he cant get certain new materials. 
	- [[The man]] explains that while there is a captive market and there is a limit on his supplies, there hasn’t been an increase in demand. His current best sellers are healing potions - he admits that no one really knows what the plague is and that healing potions wont cure disease. He recommends that people with the plague should go to the hospital OR use some form of divine magic. He suggests that rich people tend to be safe because they are distanced from everyone else. 
	- [[The man]] says that he is a regulated business, he pays his taxes and gets audited twice yearly and has to report to his guild but he doesn’t have much interaction with the health ministry in an official capacity. 
	- [[Ultrin]] starts asking about all sorts of potions. [[Jorund]] starts browsing. The shop has a potion of heroism in stock (1800GP) and can make some of the others in a few days (prices are inflated). An oil of etherealness to order would be 2500GP, potion of invisibility would be 10,000GP. [[Ultrin]] asks about a potion of vitality and if it would help with the plague, so this would be around 50,000GP.
	- [[Ultrin]] asks about poision “for self defence” against “big rats, monsters, beasts - definitely NOT humans, or gnomes” and also asks if anyone else had asked for anything like that. He is told that only select patrons get access to these.
- [[Merric]] opens the back-door and sees no traps, [[Aust]] sees no magics. There is a stockroom, with alchemical stations, much incense and an alcoholic smell. It appears to be an active workshop. The shop is visible through an open wooden archway to the front. 
	- [[Merric]] finds a desk setup for business books and papers. It looks very orderly. There is a leather bound fat stack of parchment of many sizes and shades (and ages). It has a title “recipes”.
	- [[Aust]] can see that most of the working stations are distilling healing potions, likely stronger than average and very high quality (no expense spared). One station is distilling a strange browny-green potion. Likely not a poison or antidote - maybe experimental? Don’t recognise the ingredients.
	- [[Merric]] searches the neat stacks of papers, these discuss recent batches and the ingredients used in recipes, output rates and wastage - looks legitimate. Mostly making different types of potions of healing. A recent batch lists ingredients but no yield (so likely in progress).
	- There is a ==mutagen== potion, with ingredients for making something possibly illusion based, but the other ingredients are more like a kitchen recepies - like meat & yeast. It seems like it shouldn’t work.
	- [[Merric]] calls [[Aust]] over to look at the mutagen list. He recalls folk tales about people who were desperate and tried to create more “permanent” potions - they all end badly. 
- [[Ultrin]] purchases the potion of heroism and orders the oil of etherealness (4300GP value) and asks for a discount - gets a 100GP discount. The Oil will be ready tomorrow evening (unless someone else rushes the order)
- [[Jorund]] asks about the window display and is told that some of the things are for making a Philtre of Love. [[The man]] mentions that they are only temporary. At mention of a permanent change [[Jorund]] notices the man sweat slightly. 
	- [[The man]] mentions potions of persuasiveness that can make you better at all types of charisma type activities. Prices range from 1000GP to 10,000GP.
- [[Aust]] copies down the mutagen recipe and searches the recipe book for anything that is similar to this.
	- Siren scale Fillet (meat of a siren) - cooked under moonlight
	- Moonlight hare liver (a hare caught under full moon)
	- Rose quarts powder infused with holy water
	- many secondary herbs (more digestible)
	- Searching the book, there’s no exact match, but there is a strange set of coded messages on the margins of some of the recipes (around 1 in 20/25). Finds 3-4 of them. It seems to be writing but he cant read the script, but he can feel the runes which are indented into the pages rather than inked. 
	- [[Merric]] can read the transcribed runes as some kind of Drow/Abyssal crossover. Using the Abyssal alphabet and runes to write Drow. They all translate to “start” and “end” and two to three single digit numbers between them. To [[Merric]] it looks like a coded message, [[Aust]] thinks its some sort of cipher. 
- [[Merric]] unlocks the drawer and inside finds a ledger and a small strongbox. Inside the strongbox is a fair bit of currency in platinum (around 300PP) and a lot of very small vials with varied liquids and dusts in them - assumably expensive reagents that he wants to keep safe against theft or because illicit. 
	- The ledger has work orders, some notes on sales and ingredients used and restock purchases. Two weeks ago the replenishment stops. No explicit receipts of sale
	- There are notes about [[Ivaran Sylhorn]] in reference to loans of the more esoteric recipes that were **loaned** out (Several right now) as well as other names.  These are the restricted list and are either experiments from old wizards or theories. Two stand out - philtre of vengeful whispers and elixir of night. 
	- All the recipes with hidden messages on were loaned out previously, but having been returned their names have been erased - Prof. [[Iyldan Ilstrom]], Lyral Faelrune, [[Borin Ironflask]] and Vaylin Duskwood.
- [[Merric]] and [[Aust]] leave the back and message the others that they are all finished, so they leave the shop.
- Everyone catches up down the street and [[Merric]]’s invisibility drops.
- [[Ultrin]] has heard stories of [[Iyldan Ilstrom]] for dabbling in dangerous alchemy. Unclear if he’s still in [[Neverwinter]] or not. [[Ultrin]] hasn’t heard of Lyra or Velin (they sound like fake names). [[Borin Ironflask]] is a dwarf that runs a cross over between a forge and an alchemy shop (down by where the river meets the sea, near the tradehouse) - imbuing magical properties into weapons & armour.
## Headed to [[Gilded Locket]]
- [[Jorund]] recasts invisibility on [[Merric]] and the pass without trace from [[Aust]] is still active.
- The [[Gilded Locket]] is closer to the main shopping street. It is an elegant boutique, so will be limited stock. They specialise in antique jewellery and also magic items. The shop front is ornate, with an open double door and 2 guards flanking it. There are high, barred front windows and the shop is pristine. 
	- [[Jorund]] notices the guards eyeing him up suspiciously, keeping a close eye on his weapons.
	- The shopkeep is an elven lady. [[Ultrin]] is immediately completely racist and suspicious.
	- [[Jorund]] asks to see the highlight of the shop. He is shown the amulet of unerring sands, which he is told will prevent any death not by old age (as that would still cause death). They are unsure if it would work against the zombies or plague. It was sold by a collector who wanted some cash to improve security. 100,000GP.
	- There is also an amulet of whispering winds (can cast message spell 1/day without verbal component & no attunement). 50,000 GP 
	- Also a locket of unerring sight - can see through magical darkness up to 30ft.
	- They can also imbue magics in items. 
- [[Merric]] and [[Aust]] find there is a guard down the side of the alley, doing a patrol. We sneak to the back of the shop and find a large sturdy re-enforced wooden door. [[Aust]] sees the door lock is magical (abduration)
	- [[Merric]] gives up and both he and [[Aust]] go into the shop. [[Merric]] communicates with [[Jorund]] that he should get someone to get something from the back room so he can follow them.
- [[Jorund]] asks for the best stuff and tries asking to tour the back room facilities. He is told he would need to be serious about the need to commission something and he would like to survive in the city until he can get out. 
	- [[Jorund]] suggests a magic item made of blending a pariapth of health with holy water to keep healthy and also keep undead at bay. This would cost 2500GP or 1500GP if he provided his own cleric.
- We speculate that [[Ivaran Sylhorn]] could be embezzling funds from the ministry to fund whatever super expensive thing he’s doing in the shop.
