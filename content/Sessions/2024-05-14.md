#Neverwinter 
## Walking around [[Neverwinter]] in Protector's Enclave
- [[Merric]] noticed a few places in the Protector's enclave with similar layouts and storage to [[My Chemical Reagents]]
- We head to a pottery shop which is pretty quiet. [[Jorund]] casts invisibility on [[Merric]] and then goes to talk to the potter.
	- [[Jorund]] gives his fake identity of "John Twilight" to the potter and poses as someone looking to commission pottery for his home
	- [[Merric]] sneaks around the storage area but doesn't find anything of interest
- We then head on to an apothecary where [[Jorund]] once again distracts the staff while [[Merric]] looks around the stores in the back.
	- [[Jorund]] learns from the apothecary that there is a shortage of health potions, everyone is trying to buy them up, along with antidotes (even though these do nothing useful here). [[Jorund]] ends up buying a gift pack of one of each.
	- [[Merric]] finds that the store has a few hundred health potions. They seem to have been watered down but appear mostly untainted. [[Merric]] does find 1 tainted potion with an egg in it. He takes some "samples" of a watered down potion as well as 3 health potions, 4 greater healing and 1 superior healing potions. He also takes a random potion that looks fancy - it has a large wax seal and is copper coloured.
## Walking around the Blacklake District
- We head to the Blacklake district to look for more apothecary shops. It feels like a district that is crumbling into decay. There is a heightened military presence.
- We head into a large bargain store place called [[Anyfing + Everyfing]]
	- After speaking to a member of staff we are taken into an area out the back and down in a cellar. We are shown 5 health potions that look to have been rebottled into a number of non-standard potion bottle containers (glass vials, a glass skull). It is hard to tell what they do but are clearly magic.
	- We spend 30 gold on 3 of the novelty healing potions and 2 poison vials.
- We are told that they obtain their health potions via the black market  and house estate sales - they have a gang of thieves that work across the river.
	- A lot of the potions they get seem fine but look a little "grimy". These seem to sometimes spontaneously develop an egg, at which point they take them off sale and throw them in the river.
	- We also promised to come back and pay 2 silver per wormy healing potion.
