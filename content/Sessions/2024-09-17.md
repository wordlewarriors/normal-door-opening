#Neverwinter 
## Headed to [[Raven’s nest]]
- This is close to the Dock district, buildings are less fancy and more industrial here. 
- The building is a plain large warehouse, there are many wooden stairs on the outside leading to the many levels. There are likely 100s of units inside. 
- [[Aust]] starts screaming at a [[Seagull]] and then offers it some food and speaks with it. 
	- He asks the seagull to find out if [[Ivaran Sylhorn]] has been using the building often
- Inside the building there is a human woman, a huge ledger and many lock boxes with wooden doors.
- [[Jorund]] casts invisibility on [[Merric]] and then the two of them plus [[Ultrin]] head inside. 
	- [[Jorund]] asks about renting a room and the different sizes. He asks to see some units. 
	- The woman has a crescent moon/black dragon tattoo - which is a symbol of the [[Zhentarim]]. She starts showing off the rooms.
- [[Seagull]] returns to [[Aust]] and tells him that the man has been seen at the warehouse. There have been many “shinyies” being brought and taken away from the warehouse. “Trinkets, Baubles”. 
	- People often turn up at dusk. Some people with swords enter, others go past. One person with a sword is a friend of [[Seagull]]. He is a protector of the building. 
	- [[Merric]] snaps a lock pick in the lock and takes a while to get the lock open. He then opens the lock. Inside is a think and well organised ledger with a list of storage units on each page and the customers who were rented the unit and if the unit is currently taken.
	- [[Merric]] checks the 30x30 rooms and finds no interesting names. 
	- [[Jorund]] starts talking security. She explains it’s not super high security. There are 2 copies of the keys to each locker and there is no cooperation with the authorities (unless forced) - in which case they attempt to inform the customer.
	- [[Jorund]] asks about insurance the fire risk for the wooden room. She starts walking off.
	- [[Ultrin]] casts suggestion to force her to show them both a locker on the top floor. 
		- They are shown a unit. 60GP per the day. No long term discount. 
		- If the fees aren’t payed there is an auction run at the trade house (on a slow day). The locks get changed. 
		- They are told that there have not been any break-ins for some time.
		- Sometimes people get lost.
	- [[Merric]] finds [[Ivaran Sylhorn]] is renting unit 17C (a 10x10). This reservation is long term (9-10months) compared to most others (much shorter). ==Suspiciously long.==
		- Find other shop proprietors, [[Jerrard|Jerrard Way]], various others. They are all short term and closed.
		- A neighbouring unit - 17B is rented out to Mr Anders has been for 40days, still in for another 20days.
		- [[Merric]] makes a mould from the 17C key and the master key.
	- [[Jorund]] agrees to rent the unit they viewed for a 10day. 352A
	- [[Jorund]] and [[Ultrin]] head to the [[Broken Cask]] pub. Get some ales and some food (various protein pie)
	- [[Merric]] and [[Aust]] head in search of the locker.  [[Aust]] finds the way, despite [[Merric]]’s best attempts. They find 17C. There is no lighting inside the unit. 
		- The unit is somewhat full of various boxes and creates - they are smeared in grime and covered in dust, they are not well maintained and don’t look to have been accessed. 
		- There are shelves filled with alchemy reagents and some old dusty scrolls. 
		- There is a faint unsettling smell of mildew/damp/sickly. (The rest of the facility smelled of dry wood). The floor is stained with dark splotches in some places. These have a viscous liquid texture to them, like something that seeped into it. Could have been some kind of blood? Hard to identify given the age. OR could be a spilled concoction/ichor. 
		- At the end of the unit are a number of dusty cotton sacks strewn around and full of stuff. These are very dusty, but less than the creates.
		- Poking the sacks with a stick shows they are stuffed with various misshapen things. They appear to be stuffed with many different things. Some bits are soft, others are hard. 
		- The contents are a bag of stuff that looks fit for charity donation - ornaments, clothing, rugs, blankets. It feels like they are setup to look like storing. 
		- There is a false flooring beneath the flooring. Moving this reveals an intricately carved wooden box - the carvings look like potentially magical runes. 
		- [[Aust]] uses detect magic and can see the carvings are glowing and there are hidden carvings on the floor of the compartment with conjugation magic. The floor around the box also seems warded.
		- [[Aust]] casts dispel magic which fails. [[Merric]] inspects the runes again and can see the intention is if the box is moved then something will be conjured. This also triggers on opening the box. There is also abyssal script about the binding of shadows - suggests a shadowy beast could be conjured. The wards look powerful. 
		- [[Aust]] successfully dispels the wards on the box and floor on a 2nd attempt at a higher level. [[Merric]] takes a rubbing of the etching on the box and floor and then unlocks the box (after [[Aust]] failed to open it).
		- Inside the box is lined with lead. The only thing inside is a key which has a faint aura of necromantic magic. ==It has a small emerald set into it.== 
		- There is a very thin hidden compartment in the bottom of the box. [[Merric]] breaks the box slightly to find a piece of folded parchment, it seems to be a magical blueprint for a magical artefact. It seems like a first attempt at working out an artefact but they don’t understand how. It is incomplete, so it’s hard to see what they’re creating. It seems to be a sphere and there are spirals of runes within the sphere. There are measurements on the drawing indicating it’s palm sized. There are references to “forces of destruction”. 
	- [[Merric]] inspects the other objects in the room. They seem generally in keeping with the role of a health minister - ointments, antidotes, etc. Legit healing reagents. But no health potions.
