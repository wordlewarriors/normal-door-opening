#Neverwinter 
## [[Aust]] exploring outside the city
- [[Aust]] looked around the [[House of Knowledge]]. It is open but quiet.
- [[Aust]] goes to leave [[Neverwinter]] by the exit closest to the [[Druid Grove]]. The gate is closed and guarded. Things periodically crash into the protective shield (it seems otherwise invisible?) which is around 30/40ft beyond the gate. The weather is terrible - horizontal hail. [[Aust]] stealths out using pass without trace.
- [[Aust]] headed into the [[Druid Grove]] and found an alien humanoid creature with too many appendages & kaleidoscope eyes being held aloft and being squeezed by tree branches.  There is the stench of death on the wind, something non-human or animal is decomposing. There is no sign of the druids.
	- two branches of the great tree are holding the creature - the tree has been awakened. The alien's skin is decaying, so likely to have been here a few days. It appears dead.
- There are almost no creatures in the grove, but there is a spider a squirrel and a bird. As [[Aust]] enters the grove a tree waves to him. The spider comes across to him and turns into a human - the [[Archdruid]], who stares at [[Aust]] with glazed eyes.
	- He tells [[Aust]] that the grove was attacked but is fine now. He doesn't like the magic shield around the city. He knows about the #plague and that the cure is to kill is source, which he says says was the heavens/their messengers.
	- The alien is one of the many [[Starspawn of Nihal]]. Blunt force and magic kills them.
	- The [[Archdruid]] speculates that their is darkness in the city which causes their #plague.
- The fungal plague is catastrophic, caused by an evil fungus. The [[aromycos]] has been turned evil and the [[Archdruid]] is unsure how to turn the fungus back. The mushrooms only repeat "She is wed, she is beautiful."
- [[Aust]] is given some Agate by the [[Archdruid]] and is on the hunt for a diamond. [[Aust]] tells him that he was fighting as par of the [[Sharn]] and of the fight in the [[Underdark]]. 
- The [[Archdruid]] is convinced that its the end of the world. He suggests that we kill all the worshippers of [[Kyusse]] and [[Zugtamoid]] who must be within [[Neverwinter]], driving the #plague. If we can sever the link to the [[aromycos]] then [[Zugtamoid]] could be vulnerable.
- [[Aust]]  tells the [[Archdruid]] that he needs diamonds to resurrect his mother. The [[Archdruid]] says he possible could help but wants to know how she could help.
	- [[Aust]] tells him that she used to be a protector of the forest. He thinks she would have unfinished business.
	- The [[Archdruid]] tries to find rare diamonds but is thrown off by the presence of [[Neverwinter]] and suggests looking further away from the city.
- [[Aust]] tries to get back through the force field around [[Neverwinter]] by walking through it, but finds it is solid. He tries digging under it but it looks like the shield keeps going. He then walks to the gate and is watched by guards shouting at him, which he cant hear. 
	- [[Aust]] sits outside the gate until a creature smashes into the dome, seeming to cause a moment of weakness, at which point he runs through.

## At the [[Neverwinter Manor]] 
- We are given a tour of the mansion by [[Edgar]], including the full penthouse suite on the 3rd floor. We all pick a 2nd floor bedroom, aside from [[Merric]] who takes one of the servant rooms in the basement. We are each given a key.
	- [[Aust]] arrives around sunset. [[Merric]] and [[Edgar]] are woken by knocking and let him in, then wake up the others and have a chat around the kitchen table.
- As the sun sets, bells toll and irconclad footsteps ring in the street. Some wear armour some wear cloaks. [[Aust]] stays up watching from a balcony and observes that this is a mixed task force. The task force is summoned to the [[Halls of Justice]] in what appears to be a well practised drill.
- Everyone except [[Aust]] gets a rest through the night and are woken at first signs of dawn
- [[Edgar]] makes a simple breakfast and we then head to [[Neverdeath Graveyard]].
